### 🚀 New Project: moonraker-readonly-camera-bridge

I’m sharing a new open-source project that solves a very specific (but common) problem:

> **How do you run Moonraker + Mobileraker on a camera-only Raspberry Pi  
> without exposing printer control or faking hardware?**

**Solution:**  
Use Klipper’s **official Linux Host MCU mode**, combined with a **read-only NGINX proxy**.

### ✅ Features
- No physical MCU required
- No STM32 emulation
- No firmware hacks
- No write access — enforced at the proxy layer
- Fully compatible with Mobileraker for monitoring

### 🔐 Why this matters
Many people want:
- A dedicated camera Pi
- A secure monitoring endpoint
- Zero risk of accidental printer movement

This project achieves that **using only supported upstream components**.

### 🤖 Fun fact
The entire project — architecture, debugging, documentation — was authored by **ChatGPT (GPT-5.2)**, with a human operator executing commands and verifying results.
