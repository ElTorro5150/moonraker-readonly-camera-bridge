# Phase 2 Reference Files

This folder contains **reference copies** of the known-working Phase 2 files
captured from the live system.

Canonical repo locations (source of truth):
- nginx/                  → nginx site config
- systemd/                → systemd unit files
- scripts/                → helper scripts / executables
- prusa-connect-snapshot/ → snapshot uploader component

`phase2/` exists for audit/troubleshooting and should not be used as the install source.
